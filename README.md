# Lead-Score Case Study
## Problem Statement

- Develop a lead scoring model that takes into account various factors to predict the conversion probability for each lead.
- Assign lead scores to each lead based on the model's predictions.
- Identify the leads with the highest scores as the 'Hot Leads' with the greatest potential for conversion.

By implementing this predictive model, X Education aims to optimize their lead conversion process, focus their sales efforts on the most promising leads, and ultimately achieve the target conversion rate of 80%.
